This provides the easiets, most open-source way I've found to take your RockSim design (or a pencil sketch for that matter) and break out all of the prints to be 3D printed.

The Fins and the nose cone are the trickest to convert. There is a step by step process for each in the Variables.scad file.

TODO:
2. Add Fin can creation with fin slots but no fins
3. Add support for multiple fin sets
1. Add an easy way to build the rocket (i.e. finCan(); bodyTube(); noseCone(); creates the whole rocket - translated for printing or for a 3D View)
